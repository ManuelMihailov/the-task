Dear Richard,

Thank you for contacting Kendo UI Developer Support. I am writing in reference to your email about the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core product.

First and foremost I wish to apologize for the inconvenience caused by the documentation of the product. I have created an ASP.NET Project with a working pageable grid, filter, selectable rows and and hideable collumns. I've written explanations on how I've implemented these functionalities as comments in the Views/Home/Index.cshtml file. I will also share the feedback you have given us about the documentations with the rest of my team in an attempt to improve them so such issues don't occur in the future.

Thank you for your patience. If you have any further questions, donâ€™t hesitate to let me know and I'll respond as soon as I can.

Best Regards,
Manuel
